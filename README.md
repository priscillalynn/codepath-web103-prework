## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
- Went from working on design first then functional components to the other way around
- Using React Router to basically make two projects in one then going with the better one
- Moving files and modules to vite after forgetting it was supposed to go in the vite-project folder
- Figuring out proper file structure while using vite
- Numerous design challenges (getting images to display on card components, page hero to display on each page, a LOT of conditional rendering)
- and probably more
